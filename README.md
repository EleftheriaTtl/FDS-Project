# FDS-Project

In the code I have compine all the dataframes together. The "import gc" is to clean a bit the memory that i don't use because the next line of code (featurematrix) is computationally huge. I have already saved it and i will now run the eda, missing values, polynomial features and fiting of a model in that file. I cannot upload it because it is huge. Tell me if ou want and ill send it to you via email
